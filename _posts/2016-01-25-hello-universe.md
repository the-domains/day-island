# Hello, Universe!

In times like these, when the world is spinning faster than ever. Is it?All is possible, yet there are so many things that doesn't make sense. Anything natural and organic and fresh and pure is becoming hard to find and is rather expensive, not accessible for majority. Things that should be our birthright. And in a way it seems even silly to talk about organic, when half of the world doesn't have anything to eat or wear, nowhere to live. The world is upside down and we need to find our way to live through it. One way or another.

I'm not sure what is my true path here on this Earth, seeing myself changing through the years, it would be funny to predict the future. But what's granted it that I'd like to be kind, loving- not only with people I know, but with others also, happy, creative, wealthy, healthy, honest, inspired, relaxed, balanced, trained, aware, helpful. And when there's a question (any kind), even if I wouldn't know the right answer, I'd like to see myself answering by choosing love.

This blog is helping me to grow better. And maybe You too.

I wanna share clean and fresh and durable and conscious choices and discovers that support our life on Mama Earth.

Join the Tribe!
